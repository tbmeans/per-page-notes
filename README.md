# per-page-notes

A style for typed study notes. Notes taken from a research monograph, textbook,
or any other book go into the paragraphs of any document using this style, and
the style class `.label` serves to create a small gray box floated beside the
paragraph as a label for the paragraph. The gray box would label the paragraph
beside it with the numbers of the book page(s) that the notes in the paragraph
were taken from.
